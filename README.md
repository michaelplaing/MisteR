# MisteR

MisteR provides a Redis module (mister.so) that implements MQTT over RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol),
hence MR or MisteR. It's very incomplete.

It may provide a thin library over the Redis hiredis library to make it easy to test and use MisteR module.

It may provide an MQTT reverse proxy utilizing said library to complete a useful MQTT server implmentation.

MisteR is currently a playground for me to experiment with and to rebuild my skills in C development.
